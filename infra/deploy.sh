#   deploy.sh storefront <tag>   the Next.js storefront

# <tag> is the commit SHA the images were built from. The admin and storefront
# images carry the environment as a suffix (<tag>-<ENVIRONMENT>).

# Images are built and pushed by GitHub Actions; this only pulls them. Pass
# --registry-user <user> and the token on stdin to log in to GHCR for the pull
# (the workflow sends its short-lived job token); without it, the images must
# already be present or the host already logged in. --environment <name>
# refuses to run unless it matches ENVIRONMENT in .env, so a workflow aimed at
# one environment cannot roll images onto a host set up for another.
#
# On a failed rollout the previous tag is started again and the script exits
# non-zero. Migrations are NOT reverted: see docs/deployment.md.
