/**
 * The SDK for Client Components. It talks to this storefront's own
 * /api/medusa proxy, never to Medusa directly: the proxy adds the customer's
 * token from an httpOnly cookie, and staying same-origin avoids a CORS
 * preflight on every call (Medusa sets no Access-Control-Max-Age).
 *
 * Built lazily from window.location.origin because the SDK needs an absolute
 * base URL, and a fixed one would break on preview deployments. That also makes
 * it browser-only: Server Components use lib/medusa/server.ts, and a query that
 * runs during server rendering must be prefetched with a server query function.
 *
 * Do not call `sdk.auth.*` with this instance. Login returns the token in the
 * response body, and keeping it out of the browser is the point; the
 * /api/auth/* routes handle authentication instead.
