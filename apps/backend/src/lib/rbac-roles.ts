/**
 * Provisions the store's RBAC roles.
 *
 * Called from two places so it covers both cases:
 *   - `src/migration-scripts/` so `medusa db:migrate` provisions roles on a
 *     fresh environment without anyone remembering to.
 *   - `src/scripts/` so `medusa exec` can re-run it on demand. That matters
 *     because a migration script only ever runs once: adding a module with new
 *     policies later needs a re-run to grant them, which is exactly what
 *     happened when `newsletter` was added after the roles already existed.
 *
 * Idempotent: it creates a role only when the id is absent, and attaches only
 * policies the role does not already hold. Editing a role in the dashboard is
 * therefore safe -- rerunning this will not strip policies a human removed,
 * though it will re-add any listed here that are missing.
 *
 * Super Admin is not defined here; core seeds `role_super_admin` with `*:*`.
